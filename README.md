# Auto Release Milestone
A GitHub action that automatically drafts a GitHub release based on a newly closed milestone.
The issues that were closed as part of the milestone will be used as the basis to generate the release notes.

## Inputs
### `repo-token`
**Required** The `GITHUB_TOKEN` used to access the current repository through the GitHub REST API.

## Outputs
### `release-url`
The URL of the GitHub release that was drafted. Defaults to an empty string.

## Example usage
Here's an example of a workflow that litens for the `milestone:closed` event and automatically creates a release draft with the issues that were closed as release notes. It also prints the URL of the release page to the build log.

```yaml
name: Test
on:
  milestone:
    types: [closed]
jobs:
  release:
    name: Release
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Create a release draft for a milestone
        id: create-release-milestone
        uses: qcbit/auto-release-milestone@v1
        with:
          repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Print the URL of the release draft
        if: steps.create-release-milestone.outputs.release-url != ''
        run: echo ${{ steps.create-release-draft.outputs.release-url }}
```
